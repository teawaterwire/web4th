# web4ᵗʰ

web4ᵗʰ or "temporal web" is a paradigm where time is added as a new dimension for user interactions on the web: the fourth dimension 🔮

the rationale can be found [here](https://mirror.xyz/penseur.eth/mvqOkcw0ABBgRjSD49Pb_V3lbpQMxxi68KCHabYj5RA)

this repository is meant to be used as a starter kit for those willing to try web4ᵗʰ at their next company hackathon or from the comfort of their homes

## install

1. `git clone git@github.com:teawaterwire/web4th.git && cd web4th`

2. `npm install`

3. `npm run dev` (any Java SDK > 8 is needed)

4. wait for the build to complete and open http://localhost:8280/

5. create new session

6. profit (you should see something like this 👇)

## develop

it's all about adding actions and mapping them to components

### 1, 2, 3, 4ᵗʰ steps:

1. **create a file under `src/app/actions` and add it to the existing `src/app/actions/registry.cljs`**

```clj
;; src/app/actions/new_action.cljs
(ns app.actions.new-action
  (:require
   [app.actions.entrypoint :as actions]))

;; src/app/actions/registry.cljs
(ns app.actions.registry
  (:require [app.actions.new-action]]))
```

2. **create a component that will be displayed when the action is triggered**

the component is passed an initial `state`

```clj
(defn component [state]
  [:div "something: " (:something state)])
```

an action can be triggered from a component by calling `actions/send-action`

```clj
[:button {:on-click #(actions/send-action :new-action)}]
```

optional arguments can be passed to the action

```clj
[:button {:on-click #(actions/send-action :new-action arguments)}]
```

3. **register the action by implementing the multimethod `actions/get-action`**

the method is passed three values: the action, the global db and the arguments

```clj
(defmethod actions/get-action :new-action
  [action db args]
  {:component component
   :state {:something "something"
          ;;  :and (from-global db)
          ;;  :more (from-local args)
           }})
```

the global `db` contains value like the username, the messages in the timeline or anything that can be added with [re-frame](http://day8.github.io/re-frame/)

4. **optionally use `actions/add-primary-action` to make it a primary action**

an action marked as primary can be triggered directly in the command bar, with the option to make it appear by default as well

```clj
(actions/add-primary-action :new-action "Label" {:default? true})
```

### examples

you can find examples (hello, pingpong, todolist) under the [actions/examples](https://github.com/teawaterwire/web4th/tree/master/src/app/actions/examples) folder

just comment the line in `src/app/actions/registry.cljs` if you want to deactivate them without deleting the code

### onboarding

there's a special action called `:app.actions.onboarding/onboarding` that is triggered automatically when the user logs in the first time

the matching component should be an introductory message for the user telling them what they can do with your app — don't waste the opportunity 😉

## state of the state

_what is state?_

- state is "data over time"

_but what is the purpose of data?_

- to be used by components

_for what?_

- to create new data upon the triggering of "actions"

_does it mean that in web4ᵗʰ state is spread over all components?_

- yes, each component represents a sliced snapshot of state

_isn't that inefficient?_

- components can have local state and it's up to developers to decide when snapshots should be taken (and trigger an action that will render another component)

_what's the point of this?_

- being able to keep and navigate to all previous important states of the application unlocks new capabilities
- for example, users can go back in time to components and trigger different actions that will "branch off" to a different present 🤯

## nonobvious things

### command bar

let's talk about the section at the bottom of the screen: the command bar

it's grouping three features:

1. start/stop chat with support as first-class citizen

2. trigger primary actions

3. input freeform text to either:
   - chat with support
   - filter through primary and non-default actions
   - just write anything like on a notebook

### support

to understand what is support as first-class citizen:

1. go to https://app.element.io/#/register

2. change "matrix.org" to "https://matrix.teawaterwire.dev"

3. choose a username/password and click "register"

4. replace "support" with your username in `src/app/config.cljs`

then back from the application click "Start chat with support"

this will invite the support account you created in the "conversation" between the app and the end-user

on the support side you can now send messages to the user, but more importantly also actions that will be displayed as components!

### app-id

you might wonder what is this `app-id` in the config file... glad you asked!

the history of interactions between the user and the app is stored as messages in a chat room

when the user signs up this "room" is created and the account `app-id` immediately invited

later on the `support-id` will be invited and kicked again from the room depending on what the end user wants

but the `app-id` will always stay in the room, as if it was an admin account with access to the entire history of the user's interactions

_(you can register your own app account the same way you registered the support account)_

## release

using [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) it's as simple as connecting your GitHub repository and adding these settings:

> Framework preset: `None`
>
> build command: `npm run release`
>
> Build output directory: `/resources/public`
>
> Root directory: `/`
>
> Environment variables: `NODE_VERSION` = 16

click "Save and Deploy" and voilà 💫

## style

need help plz 🎨 (using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) btw - it's great)

## post rationalisation

choices were made

### Sessions

authentication is inevitable but has to be as frictionless as possible

a private key / public key provided by crypto wallet was the first guess, but friction was still there

using biometrics to authenticate is frictionless, but support was limited (only on desktop with magic.link)

it was finally decided to identify a user by a session `id` that is randomly generated upon creation

a user can save that `id` to "load" the session on another browser if needed

_it is up to the app developer to add other auth systems within a session (allowing for instance different crypto wallets to be connected under the same session)_

### Matrix

a decentralized conversation store was the key missing ingredient for a true web4ᵗʰ app

leveraging their work at the protocol level but also at the application level: existing cross platform clients can be used to interact with users (support account)

_for convenience a Matrix homeserver is deployed at matrix.teawaterwire.dev but you can deploy your own relatively easily following this helpful [tutorial](https://pcarion.com/posts/matrix-dendrite-install/) (and passing the `--really-enable-open-registration` flag)_

### ClojureScript

it feels right to use immutable data for immutable conversations

but ClojureScript has other advantages:

- true interactive programming with a REPL ([Calva](https://calva.io/) recommended)
- [re-frame](http://day8.github.io/re-frame/) to get smooth global state management
- [reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io/) for the most elegant way to write React component

people not willing to write a single lispy parenthesis can just write JavaScript (and React components) — the amazing tool which is [shadow-cljs](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#classpath-js) will deal with it 😌
